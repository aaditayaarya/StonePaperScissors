# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to select their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and then it compares the player's choice with a randomly generated computer choice to determine the winner. The game interface includes visually appealing buttons for user selection and displays the result of each round. This project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic CSS styling. It is a great starting point for beginners looking to learn JavaScript and web development.
